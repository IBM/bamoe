# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions

[IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions](https://www.ibm.com/products/business-automation-manager-open-editions) (BAMOE) is a Business Automation foundational platform for developing, deploying, managing, and monitoring Enterprise-grade, cloud-native Business Services in hybrid-cloud enviroments, such as [Red HatÂ® OpenShiftÂ®](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redhat.com%2Fen%2Ftechnologies%2Fcloud-computing%2Fopenshift) and Kubernetes.

IBM BAMOE is based on Open-Source [Apache KIE](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkie.apache.org) technologies such as Drools, jBPM, and Kogito, and provides a set of libraries, applications and tools that adapt to your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and integrate with services and technologies that you are probably already using:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code),
- Git-based source code hosting services,
- Event streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka, and
- Popular microservice monitoring and metrics technologies such as Prometheus.

Business Services built on IBM BAMOE contain domain-specific logic in the form of **Workflows**, **Decisions**, **Rules**, and **Decision Tables**, all based on open standards, like [Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omg.org%2Fspec%2FBPMN%2F2.0%2FAbout-BPMN), [Decision Model and Notation (DMN)](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omg.org%2Fspec%2FDMN) and the [Drools Rule Language (DRL)](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.drools.org%2F8.44.0.Final%2Fdrools-docs%2Fdrools%2Flanguage-reference%2Findex.html), or well-established formats, like regular spreadsheets.

IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions empowers you to transform regular containerized microservices based on [Quarkus](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fquarkus.io%2F) or [Spring Boot](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspring.io%2Fprojects%2Fspring-boot) into domain-rich Business Services, combining your custom logic and functionality with Workflows, Decisions, Rules, and/or Decision Tables. IBM BAMOE allows you to be in full control of your Business Services, their development lifecycle, deployment strategy, topology, and scale.
